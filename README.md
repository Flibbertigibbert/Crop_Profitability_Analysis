# Crop_Profitability_Analysis
Background

AgResources Inc. is poised for expansion and strategic investment in its farms. The vast data collated over the years serves as a treasure trove to carve out the company's future direction. But decisions must be precise, deliberate, and data-driven.

This is a project for the DATAFEST HACKATHON  2023 DATAANALYSIS SECTION 

Objective
To extract in-depth insights and recommendations that will shape the company's strategic plans for the coming years.

# Business Requirement 1: Crop Profitability Analysis
Given our crop yields and the varying environmental factors, which crops are most profitable across our farms? How might changes in soil, pests, or weather conditions project into future profitability?

# APPROACH

Key Steps in the Analysis:
To fulfill this requirement, we have undertaken the following key steps:

1. Data Aggregation:
   - We aggregated relevant data from our farms into a comprehensive dataset, which includes information on crop type, crop yield, soil moisture, soil pH, humidity, temperature, light intensity, growth stage, pest severity, pest type, weather conditions, wind speed, and precipitation.

2. Grouping and Calculation:
   - Using the collected data, we grouped the information by crop type and calculated various statistics, including total crop yield, mean soil moisture, mean soil pH, mean humidity, mean temperature, mean light intensity, and counts for growth stage, pest severity, pest type, weather conditions, wind speed, and precipitation.

3. Ranking Crops by Profitability:
   - We ranked the crops based on their crop yield in descending order. This ranking allows us to identify the most profitable crops across our farms.

Key Findings:

1. Rice The Most Profitable: Among the crops analyzed, rice emerged as the undisputed champion in terms of profitability, boasting a crop yield of 1,440,547.72 kg/m2. Its success can be attributed to favorable soil moisture, pH, and humidity levels.

2. Potato and Carrot Follow Closely: Not far behind, potato and carrot claimed the second and third positions, respectively, in the profitability rankings. Their impressive crop yields were supported by balanced environmental conditions.

3. Corn, Tomato, and Cotton Hold Their Ground: Corn, tomato, and cotton also displayed strong profitability, showcasing the resilience of these crops in varying conditions.

4. Sugarcane, Barley, Soybean, and Wheat Round Out the List:Completing the list are sugarcane, barley, soybean, and wheat, each with its own level of profitability. Sugarcane, despite lower soil moisture, managed to maintain its profitability.

5. Weather Conditions are Steady: Across all crops, weather conditions and wind speed remained relatively consistent, indicating minimal variations.

## Recommendations

Based on the results of the Crop Profitability Analysis, several recommendations can be made to optimize crop selection and farming practices:

1. Increase Rice Production: Given that rice has consistently demonstrated the highest profitability, consider allocating more resources and land for rice cultivation. Focus on maintaining the favorable soil moisture, pH, and humidity levels that contribute to its success.

2. Diversify with Potato and Carrot: While rice dominates in profitability, diversify your crop portfolio by expanding potato and carrot cultivation. These crops have shown strong profitability and can complement rice production.

3. Manage Corn, Tomato, and Cotton: Continue cultivating corn, tomato, and cotton, which also exhibit good profitability. Ensure that the environmental conditions, such as soil moisture and pH, are optimized for these crops to maintain their profitability.

4. Optimize Sugarcane Production: Although sugarcane ranks lower in profitability, it can still be a viable option. Focus on improving soil moisture and pest control measures to boost sugarcane yields.

5. Monitor Barley, Soybean, and Wheat: Keep a close eye on barley, soybean, and wheat. While they may be less profitable, they can serve as rotational crops to improve soil health. 

6. Weather Data Collection: Address the data gaps in weather conditions, wind speed, and precipitation, especially for cotton and wheat. Collect and analyze this missing data to better understand the impact of weather on crop profitability.
